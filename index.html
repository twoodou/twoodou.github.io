        <p>My name is Thomas Wood and I am an enthusiastic web developer.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Construction Science from the University of Oklahoma in 2013, and began my professional career in commercial construction management.  I began in the field, working as a Field Engineer on the University of Texas' Dell Medical School Research Facility in Austin, TX.  I went through the ranks, ending my corporate career in Oklahoma as a Project Manager.  I then started my own business called Wood's Construction Services, and eventually moved to Houston, TX.  </p>

        <p>While my background has been primarily in construction, I have always had a passion for technology.  At the age of 14, I saved up money by working in  my father's auto parts warehouse and I built my first computer.  I used this computer to play my favorite video games and chat with fellow gamers via website forums.  Through these forums, I was first introduced to HTML.  While I regret not pursuing web development any further than HTML until recently, I value my time spent in construction management because it gave me the ambition and leadership that will prove valuable in any career.  I hope you enjoy my personal website and feel free to contact me with any comments or questions.</p>
